![Brie](/assets/brie.webp)

Hi, I'm Brie, and I'm a 2D character animator. I grew up in upstate South Carolina and I'm currently finishing up my Animation degree at Savannah College of Art and Design.

I specialize in character animation and storyboarding, and I'm inspired by the snappy, impactful animation of the Street Fighter games, as well as the works of Peter Chung.

In my spare time, I dabble in game design and making comics. My two side projects right now are a fighting game titled Riots in Rat City, and an animated short titled Space Mall.
